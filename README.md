# Contact Book App (Python Console Application)

This is a simple yet functional *Contact Book application* built using Python. It allows users to manage personal contacts through a console-based interface, making it easy to store, update, and retrieve contact information.

## Features

## How It Works

All contacts are stored in a Python *dictionary*, where the contact name is the key and the value is another dictionary containing:

```python
{
  'age': 25,
  'email': 'example@email.com',
  'mobile': '9876543210'
}
